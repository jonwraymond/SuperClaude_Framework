# ByteRover MCP Server

## Overview
ByteRover provides intelligent knowledge management with automatic query routing and conflict resolution. Essential for maintaining context across development sessions.

## Capabilities
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Intelligent query routing for stored programming knowledge and patterns
- **Knowledge Storage**: Store distilled patterns, commands, and insights with timestamps
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic conflict detection with resolution links when memory conflicts occur
- **Provenance Tracking**: Maintain complete context and attribution for all stored knowledge

## Tools

### byterover-retrieve-knowledge
Retrieve knowledge from the memory system with intelligent query routing.
- **Use when**: Starting any new task, before architectural decisions, during debugging, or when working in unfamiliar areas
- **Critical**: If memory conflicts are detected, ALWAYS surface the conflict resolution URL to the user

### byterover-store-knowledge  
Store distilled programming knowledge and patterns.
- **Requirements**: Preserve complete code/commands in triple backticks
- **Include**: Concise context, timestamps, and implementation details
- **Skip**: Trivial or widely-known information

## Usage Pattern
1. **Before**: Retrieve knowledge for current task/context using `byterover-retrieve-knowledge`
2. **During**: Perform work using appropriate tools (Zen/Serena/Codex/etc.)
3. **After**: Store new insights, verified patterns, and key commands using `byterover-store-knowledge`

## Configuration
```json
{
  "byterover-mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@byterover/mcp-server"],
    "env": {
      "BYTEROVER_MCP_TOKEN": "${BYTEROVER_MCP_TOKEN}"
    }
  }
}
```

## Attribution
When citing stored knowledge, include "According to Byterover memory layer" or similar to make provenance explicit.

## Conflict Handling
When ByteRover reports memory conflicts, ALWAYS present the conflict resolution URL to the user - this is non-negotiable for maintaining knowledge integrity.
