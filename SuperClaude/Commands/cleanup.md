# /sc:cleanup - Code and Project Cleanup

> **Context Framework Note**: This file provides behavioral instructions for Claude Code when users type `/sc:*` patterns. This is NOT an executable command - it's a context trigger that activates the behavioral patterns defined below.

## Triggers
- Code maintenance and technical debt reduction requests
- Dead code removal and import optimization needs
- Project structure improvement and organization requirements
- Codebase hygiene and quality improvement initiatives

## Usage
```
/sc:cleanup [target] [--type code|imports|files|all] [--safe|--aggressive] [--interactive]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Analyze**: Assess cleanup opportunities and safety considerations across target scope
2. **Plan**: Choose cleanup approach and activate relevant personas for domain expertise
3. **Execute**: Apply systematic cleanup with intelligent dead code detection and removal
4. **Validate**: Ensure no functionality loss through testing and safety verification
5. **Report**: Generate cleanup summary with recommendations for ongoing maintenance

Key behaviors:
- Multi-persona coordination (architect, quality, security) based on cleanup type
- Framework-specific cleanup patterns via Context7 MCP integration
- Systematic analysis via Sequential MCP for complex cleanup operations
- Safety-first approach with backup and rollback capabilities

## MCP Integration

### Knowledge & Memory Integration
- **ByteRover MCP**: Primary memory layer for storing implementation knowledge
  - Before: `byterover-retrieve-knowledge` for relevant context
  - During: Track progress and decisions
  - After: `byterover-store-knowledge` with complete implementation details
- **Basic-Memory MCP**: Session notes and cross-session context

### Workflow Integration (per AGENTS.md)
1. **Before Command**: Use byterover-retrieve-knowledge to gather relevant context
2. **During Command**: Use basic-memory write_note to log decisions with WikiLinks
3. **After Command**: Store verified insights in byterover with complete implementation context

```
Before Command:
  → byterover-retrieve-knowledge(query="relevant context")

During Command:
  → Track decisions and progress
  → Document key findings

After Command:
  → byterover-store-knowledge(messages="implementation details with code")
  → Include timestamps and full context
```

- **Sequential MCP**: Auto-activated for complex multi-step cleanup analysis and planning
- **Context7 MCP**: Framework-specific cleanup patterns and best practices
- **Persona Coordination**: Architect (structure), Quality (debt), Security (credentials)

## Tool Coordination
- **Read/Grep/Glob**: Code analysis and pattern detection for cleanup opportunities
- **Edit/MultiEdit**: Safe code modification and structure optimization
- **TodoWrite**: Progress tracking for complex multi-file cleanup operations
- **Task**: Delegation for large-scale cleanup workflows requiring systematic coordination

## Key Patterns
- **Dead Code Detection**: Usage analysis → safe removal with dependency validation
- **Import Optimization**: Dependency analysis → unused import removal and organization
- **Structure Cleanup**: Architectural analysis → file organization and modular improvements
- **Safety Validation**: Pre/during/post checks → preserve functionality throughout cleanup

## Examples

### Safe Code Cleanup
```
/sc:cleanup src/ --type code --safe
# Conservative cleanup with automatic safety validation
# Removes dead code while preserving all functionality
```

### Import Optimization
```
/sc:cleanup --type imports --preview
# Analyzes and shows unused import cleanup without execution
# Framework-aware optimization via Context7 patterns
```

### Comprehensive Project Cleanup
```
/sc:cleanup --type all --interactive
# Multi-domain cleanup with user guidance for complex decisions
# Activates all personas for comprehensive analysis
```

### Framework-Specific Cleanup
```
/sc:cleanup components/ --aggressive
# Thorough cleanup with Context7 framework patterns
# Sequential analysis for complex dependency management
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Systematically clean code, remove dead code, and optimize project structure
- Provide comprehensive safety validation with backup and rollback capabilities
- Apply intelligent cleanup algorithms with framework-specific pattern recognition

**Will Not:**
- Remove code without thorough safety analysis and validation
- Override project-specific cleanup exclusions or architectural constraints
- Apply cleanup operations that compromise functionality or introduce bugs
