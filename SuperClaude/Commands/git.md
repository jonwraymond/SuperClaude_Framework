# /sc:git - Git Operations

> **Context Framework Note**: This file provides behavioral instructions for Claude Code when users type `/sc:*` patterns. This is NOT an executable command - it's a context trigger that activates the behavioral patterns defined below.

## Triggers
- Git repository operations: status, add, commit, push, pull, branch
- Need for intelligent commit message generation
- Repository workflow optimization requests
- Branch management and merge operations

## Usage
```
/sc:git [operation] [args] [--smart-commit] [--interactive]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Analyze**: Check repository state and working directory changes
2. **Validate**: Ensure operation is appropriate for current Git context
3. **Execute**: Run Git command with intelligent automation
4. **Optimize**: Apply smart commit messages and workflow patterns
5. **Report**: Provide status and next steps guidance

Key behaviors:
- Generate conventional commit messages based on change analysis
- Apply consistent branch naming conventions
- Handle merge conflicts with guided resolution
- Provide clear status summaries and workflow recommendations

## Tool Coordination
- **Bash**: Git command execution and repository operations
- **Read**: Repository state analysis and configuration review
- **Grep**: Log parsing and status analysis
- **Write**: Commit message generation and documentation

## Key Patterns
- **Smart Commits**: Analyze changes → generate conventional commit message
- **Status Analysis**: Repository state → actionable recommendations
- **Branch Strategy**: Consistent naming and workflow enforcement
- **Error Recovery**: Conflict resolution and state restoration guidance

## Examples

### Smart Status Analysis
```
/sc:git status
# Analyzes repository state with change summary
# Provides next steps and workflow recommendations
```

### Intelligent Commit
```
/sc:git commit --smart-commit
# Generates conventional commit message from change analysis
# Applies best practices and consistent formatting
```

### Interactive Operations
```
/sc:git merge feature-branch --interactive
# Guided merge with conflict resolution assistance
```


## MCP Integration

### Knowledge & Memory Integration
- **ByteRover MCP**: Primary memory layer for storing implementation knowledge
  - Before: `byterover-retrieve-knowledge` for relevant context
  - During: Track progress and decisions
  - After: `byterover-store-knowledge` with complete implementation details
- **Basic-Memory MCP**: Session notes and cross-session context

### Workflow Integration (per AGENTS.md)
1. **Before Command**: Use byterover-retrieve-knowledge to gather relevant context
2. **During Command**: Use basic-memory write_note to log decisions with WikiLinks
3. **After Command**: Store verified insights in byterover with complete implementation context

```
Before Command:
  → byterover-retrieve-knowledge(query="relevant context")

During Command:
  → Track decisions and progress
  → Document key findings

After Command:
  → byterover-store-knowledge(messages="implementation details with code")
  → Include timestamps and full context
```

### Tool Coordination
- **Analysis & Research**: Sequential-thinking, Exa, Context7 for deep investigation
- **Development**: Morphllm, Serena for code changes and project memory
- **Documentation**: Ref, Context7 for framework-specific docs


## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Execute Git operations with intelligent automation
- Generate conventional commit messages from change analysis
- Provide workflow optimization and best practice guidance

**Will Not:**
- Modify repository configuration without explicit authorization
- Execute destructive operations without confirmation
- Handle complex merges requiring manual intervention
