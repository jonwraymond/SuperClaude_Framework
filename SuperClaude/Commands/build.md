# /sc:build - Project Building and Packaging

> **Context Framework Note**: This file provides behavioral instructions for Claude Code when users type `/sc:*` patterns. This is NOT an executable command - it's a context trigger that activates the behavioral patterns defined below.

## Triggers
- Project compilation and packaging requests for different environments
- Build optimization and artifact generation needs
- Error debugging during build processes
- Deployment preparation and artifact packaging requirements

## Usage
```
/sc:build [target] [--type dev|prod|test] [--clean] [--optimize] [--verbose]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Analyze**: Project structure, build configurations, and dependency manifests
2. **Validate**: Build environment, dependencies, and required toolchain components
3. **Execute**: Build process with real-time monitoring and error detection
4. **Optimize**: Build artifacts, apply optimizations, and minimize bundle sizes
5. **Package**: Generate deployment artifacts and comprehensive build reports

Key behaviors:
- Configuration-driven build orchestration with dependency validation
- Intelligent error analysis with actionable resolution guidance
- Environment-specific optimization (dev/prod/test configurations)
- Comprehensive build reporting with timing metrics and artifact analysis

## MCP Integration

### Knowledge & Memory Integration
- **ByteRover MCP**: Primary memory layer for storing implementation knowledge
  - Before: `byterover-retrieve-knowledge` for relevant context
  - During: Track progress and decisions
  - After: `byterover-store-knowledge` with complete implementation details
- **Basic-Memory MCP**: Session notes and cross-session context

### Workflow Integration (per AGENTS.md)
1. **Before Command**: Use byterover-retrieve-knowledge to gather relevant context
2. **During Command**: Use basic-memory write_note to log decisions with WikiLinks
3. **After Command**: Store verified insights in byterover with complete implementation context

```
Before Command:
  → byterover-retrieve-knowledge(query="relevant context")

During Command:
  → Track decisions and progress
  → Document key findings

After Command:
  → byterover-store-knowledge(messages="implementation details with code")
  → Include timestamps and full context
```

- **Playwright MCP**: Auto-activated for build validation and UI testing during builds
- **DevOps Engineer Persona**: Activated for build optimization and deployment preparation
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Build pipeline integration, performance monitoring, artifact validation

## Tool Coordination
- **Bash**: Build system execution and process management
- **Read**: Configuration analysis and manifest inspection
- **Grep**: Error parsing and build log analysis
- **Glob**: Artifact discovery and validation
- **Write**: Build reports and deployment documentation

## Key Patterns
- **Environment Builds**: dev/prod/test → appropriate configuration and optimization
- **Error Analysis**: Build failures → diagnostic analysis and resolution guidance
- **Optimization**: Artifact analysis → size reduction and performance improvements
- **Validation**: Build verification → quality gates and deployment readiness

## Examples

### Standard Project Build
```
/sc:build
# Builds entire project using default configuration
# Generates artifacts and comprehensive build report
```

### Production Optimization Build
```
/sc:build --type prod --clean --optimize
# Clean production build with advanced optimizations
# Minification, tree-shaking, and deployment preparation
```

### Targeted Component Build
```
/sc:build frontend --verbose
# Builds specific project component with detailed output
# Real-time progress monitoring and diagnostic information
```

### Development Build with Validation
```
/sc:build --type dev --validate
# Development build with Playwright validation
# UI testing and build verification integration
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Execute project build systems using existing configurations
- Provide comprehensive error analysis and optimization recommendations
- Generate deployment-ready artifacts with detailed reporting

**Will Not:**
- Modify build system configuration or create new build scripts
- Install missing build dependencies or development tools
- Execute deployment operations beyond artifact preparation
