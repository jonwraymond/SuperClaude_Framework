# /sc:test - Testing and Quality Assurance

> **Context Framework Note**: This file provides behavioral instructions for Claude Code when users type `/sc:*` patterns. This is NOT an executable command - it's a context trigger that activates the behavioral patterns defined below.

## Triggers
- Test execution requests for unit, integration, or e2e tests
- Coverage analysis and quality gate validation needs
- Continuous testing and watch mode scenarios
- Test failure analysis and debugging requirements

## Usage
```
/sc:test [target] [--type unit|integration|e2e|all] [--coverage] [--watch] [--fix]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Discover**: Categorize available tests using runner patterns and conventions
2. **Configure**: Set up appropriate test environment and execution parameters
3. **Execute**: Run tests with monitoring and real-time progress tracking
4. **Analyze**: Generate coverage reports and failure diagnostics
5. **Report**: Provide actionable recommendations and quality metrics

Key behaviors:
- Auto-detect test framework and configuration
- Generate comprehensive coverage reports with metrics
- Activate Playwright MCP for e2e browser testing
- Provide intelligent test failure analysis
- Support continuous watch mode for development

## MCP Integration

### Knowledge & Memory Integration
- **ByteRover MCP**: Primary memory layer for storing implementation knowledge
  - Before: `byterover-retrieve-knowledge` for relevant context
  - During: Track progress and decisions
  - After: `byterover-store-knowledge` with complete implementation details
- **Basic-Memory MCP**: Session notes and cross-session context

### Workflow Integration (per AGENTS.md)
1. **Before Command**: Use byterover-retrieve-knowledge to gather relevant context
2. **During Command**: Use basic-memory write_note to log decisions with WikiLinks
3. **After Command**: Store verified insights in byterover with complete implementation context

```
Before Command:
  → byterover-retrieve-knowledge(query="relevant context")

During Command:
  → Track decisions and progress
  → Document key findings

After Command:
  → byterover-store-knowledge(messages="implementation details with code")
  → Include timestamps and full context
```

- **Playwright MCP**: Auto-activated for `--type e2e` browser testing
- **QA Specialist Persona**: Activated for test analysis and quality assessment
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Cross-browser testing, visual validation, performance metrics

## Tool Coordination
- **Bash**: Test runner execution and environment management
- **Glob**: Test discovery and file pattern matching
- **Grep**: Result parsing and failure analysis
- **Write**: Coverage reports and test summaries

## Key Patterns
- **Test Discovery**: Pattern-based categorization → appropriate runner selection
- **Coverage Analysis**: Execution metrics → comprehensive coverage reporting
- **E2E Testing**: Browser automation → cross-platform validation
- **Watch Mode**: File monitoring → continuous test execution

## Examples

### Basic Test Execution
```
/sc:test
# Discovers and runs all tests with standard configuration
# Generates pass/fail summary and basic coverage
```

### Targeted Coverage Analysis
```
/sc:test src/components --type unit --coverage
# Unit tests for specific directory with detailed coverage metrics
```

### Browser Testing
```
/sc:test --type e2e
# Activates Playwright MCP for comprehensive browser testing
# Cross-browser compatibility and visual validation
```

### Development Watch Mode
```
/sc:test --watch --fix
# Continuous testing with automatic simple failure fixes
# Real-time feedback during development
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Execute existing test suites using project's configured test runner
- Generate coverage reports and quality metrics
- Provide intelligent test failure analysis with actionable recommendations

**Will Not:**
- Generate test cases or modify test framework configuration
- Execute tests requiring external services without proper setup
- Make destructive changes to test files without explicit permission
