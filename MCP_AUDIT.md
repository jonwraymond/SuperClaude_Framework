## Memory Operations Audit

### Current Memory Tools
1. **Byterover** (Primary) - HTTP-based, JWT auth
2. **Basic Memory** (Secondary) - Local file-based

### Memory Usage Patterns Required

#### Every Command MUST Include:
1. **Pre-execution**: Retrieve relevant knowledge
2. **During execution**: Track progress
3. **Post-execution**: Store findings/results

#### Every Agent MUST Include:
1. **Initialization**: Load agent-specific knowledge
2. **Decision points**: Store reasoning
3. **Completion**: Save outcomes and learnings

## Action Items

### 1. Create Missing MCP Documentation
- [ ] SuperClaude/MCP/MCP_Zen.md
- [ ] SuperClaude/MCP/MCP_GitHub.md
- [ ] SuperClaude/MCP/MCP_Time.md
- [ ] SuperClaude/MCP/MCP_DesktopCommander.md
- [ ] SuperClaude/MCP/MCP_Repomix.md
- [ ] SuperClaude/MCP/MCP_Octocode.md
- [ ] SuperClaude/MCP/MCP_Cerebras.md

### 2. Add Memory Operations to Commands
Review each command in `SuperClaude/Commands/` for:
- [ ] analyze.md
- [ ] brainstorm.md
- [ ] build.md
- [ ] business-panel.md
- [ ] cleanup.md
- [ ] design.md
- [ ] document.md
- [ ] estimate.md
- [ ] explain.md
- [ ] git.md
- [ ] help.md
- [ ] implement.md
- [ ] improve.md
- [ ] index.md
- [ ] load.md
- [ ] reflect.md
- [ ] research.md
- [ ] save.md
- [ ] select-tool.md
- [ ] spawn.md
- [ ] spec-panel.md
- [ ] task.md
- [ ] test.md
- [ ] troubleshoot.md
- [ ] workflow.md

### 3. Add Memory Operations to Agents
Review each agent in `SuperClaude/Agents/` for:
- [ ] backend-architect.md
- [ ] business-panel-experts.md
- [ ] deep-research-agent.md
- [ ] devops-architect.md
- [ ] frontend-architect.md
- [ ] learning-guide.md
- [ ] performance-engineer.md
- [ ] python-expert.md
- [ ] quality-engineer.md
- [ ] refactoring-expert.md
- [ ] requirements-analyst.md
- [ ] root-cause-analyst.md
- [ ] security-engineer.md
- [ ] socratic-mentor.md
- [ ] system-architect.md
- [ ] technical-writer.md

### 4. Update core/MCP_TOOLS.md
- [ ] Add missing tools (zen, github, time, etc.)
- [ ] Emphasize memory operations in each tool description
- [ ] Add memory workflow diagrams

## Memory Integration Template

### For Commands:
```markdown
## Memory Operations

### Before Execution
1. Retrieve relevant knowledge:
   - byterover-retrieve-knowledge(query="[command context]")
   - Check for active plans or previous executions

### During Execution
2. Track progress:
   - Store intermediate findings
   - Log decision points
   - Update task status

### After Execution
3. Store results:
   - byterover-store-knowledge(findings + code + insights)
   - Update completion status
   - Link to related work
```

### For Agents:
```markdown
## Memory Integration

### Agent Initialization
- Load agent-specific knowledge base
- Retrieve past similar tasks
- Check for domain-specific patterns

### Decision Making
- Store reasoning traces
- Document alternative approaches considered
- Record why certain paths were chosen

### Task Completion
- Save complete solution with context
- Store learnings and gotchas
- Update agent knowledge base
```

---

## Priority Execution Order

1. **CRITICAL**: Add memory operations to all commands (24 files)
2. **CRITICAL**: Add memory operations to all agents (16 files)
3. **HIGH**: Create missing MCP docs (7 files)
4. **HIGH**: Update core/MCP_TOOLS.md with complete inventory
5. **MEDIUM**: Add memory workflow diagrams
6. **LOW**: Create cerebras-code documentation

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Every command mentions memory operations
✅ Every agent includes memory integration
✅ All configured MCP servers documented
✅ Memory operations appear in examples
✅ Clear memory workflow in each file
✅ Byterover + Basic Memory consistently referenced

---

## Next Steps

1. Start with Commands (highest impact)
2. Then Agents (second highest impact)
3. Fill in missing MCP docs
4. Update master tools documentation
5. Create memory best practices guide
